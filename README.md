# Medicine Recommendation System 
An AI-powered system that recommends medicines based on gender, symptoms, causes, and disease using a Decision Tree Classifier (DTC).

# Project Overview
This project utilizes Machine Learning and Data Processing to analyze patient symptoms and suggest the most appropriate medicine. The system takes inputs like gender, symptoms, causes, and disease, processes them using a Decision Tree Classifier, and provides accurate medication recommendations. It also features a GUI built with Tkinter for user-friendly interaction.

# Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Tkinter
Machine Learning Algorithm: Decision Tree Classifier (DTC)
Data Processing: Label Encoding for categorical data

# Features
1. Predict medicines based on patient input.
2. Uses Decision Tree Classifier for recommendation.
3. GUI built with Tkinter for easy user interaction.
4. Supports multiple symptoms, causes, and diseases.

# Future Improvements
1. Improve model accuracy with a larger dataset.
2. Integrate NLP for symptom-based query analysis.
3. Deploy as a Flask API for web-based access.
